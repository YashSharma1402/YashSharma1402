Hello, my name is Yash Sharma. I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in CCVT from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, with a CGPA of 7.51. I have a strong academic foundation, supported by consistent performance in school with 94.8% in secondary and 90% in higher secondary education.

During my academic journey, I developed a deep interest in cloud computing, DevOps, and full-stack development, which led me to work on several technical projects and internships. I’ve gained hands-on experience through roles at Deloitte, IBM, and Sentientia AI, where I contributed to real-world projects involving AWS cloud services, application deployment, and system migration.

For example, at IBM, I assisted in migrating legacy applications to cloud-native architectures using AWS services such as EC2, S3, and VPC. At Deloitte, I worked on projects under the SAP Department of the Technology and Transformation function, where I understood how technology aligns with business operations. Similarly, at Sentientia AI, I took ownership of full-stack deployment across multiple platforms, ensuring collaboration between the frontend and backend teams for reliable delivery.

Apart from my internships, I have built projects like Hired Hub – a job-searching portal using Django, and a Code Snippet Organizer, which reflects my problem-solving ability and interest in building efficient digital solutions.

I’m also a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner and have completed multiple AWS Academy certifications, which strengthen my technical foundation in cloud infrastructure and architecture.

Beyond technical knowledge, I’m a quick learner, detail-oriented, and enjoy working in a team environment. My blend of technical expertise and communication skills helps me bridge the gap between technology and business, which is why I’m particularly interested in roles like Sales Account Manager, where I can combine my technical understanding with relationship-building and strategic selling.

In short, I’m someone who enjoys learning, collaborating, and contributing to growth — both personal and organizational.
